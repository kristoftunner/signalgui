# signalgui
A simple Qt app for signal processing visualization 

This GUI would be a basis of my future GUI application where there is a need for signal processing

## Features(to be expanded in the future)
- digesting signal feed from different resources, for example: zmq stream, locally generated signal
- signal plotting for various purposes
  -  plotting basic signal properties, like DFT, PSD
  -  some advanced features expected in the future:
    - plotting geo map data, like plotting ultrasonic signal on a map 
    - plotting radar data similarly 
  - plotting sequential time based data, like power consumption over a month

## Architecture
First of all I will do some prototyping, afterwards I will draw the conclusion and come up with a clear and highly extensible SW architecture
